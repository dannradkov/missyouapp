# missyouapp
missyouapp
This repository contains a simple, single-page HTML app (for now). It calculates the current time and shows how much time is left until the next meeting with my favorite person.
What it does


Detects the current time


Computes the remaining time until the next scheduled meeting


Displays the countdown in a clean, lightweight web page


Deployment


✅ Tested on Azure App Service


☁️ Can also be deployed as a static website on Azure Storage Account (Static Website feature)


Notes
This is intentionally minimal at the moment—just HTML (and any embedded JS/CSS if needed). Future improvements may include configuration options, better UI, and multiple upcoming meetings.
